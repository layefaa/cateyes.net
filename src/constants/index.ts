Whether I'm home or wandering through the city, my camera is always by my side, ready to capture the world around me. In addition to my love of photography, I also enjoy cooking and creating delicious meals for my family and friends. On Sundays, I like to relax and unwind by practicing my guitar and singing, always striving to improve my musical skills. These hobbies bring me joy and help me to recharge after a busy week of shooting and editing."
